# Design Token Audit Tool - Acceptance Criteria

## Overview
The Design Token Audit Tool is a web application that analyzes Figma files to identify hardcoded design values and match them with design tokens from a JSON file. It provides detailed insights into tokenization status, suggests token matches, and offers recommendations for improving design system consistency.
